Get A Bitcasa Developer API Key
===============================
In order to access the API successfully, you need to first get an API key from Bitcasa:

* Either sign up with your Bitcasa account, or log in with it
* Click "Console" on the top header, and "Create App" on the top right

Using The Bitcasa API
